James’ role within the university is to lead the Tibetan Buddhist translation project that is 84000’s core mission, as well as to work on encyclopedic studies of Buddhist meditative systems found in those canons as a collaboration between 84000 and the university’s Center of Contemplative Studies.</p>

The project is also developing IT tools for the linguistic analysis and comparison of the texts, for which our Reading Room, and backend data on its use, serves as a crucial resource.</p>
