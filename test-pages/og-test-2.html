Like most of the sūtras in the <span class="text-sa glossarize-complete title">Ratnakūṭa</span>, it was translated into Tibetan from a Sanskrit original that is now lost, but that may have dated back as far as the 1st or 2nd centuries CE, i.e. several centuries before the collection itself was compiled. </p><p id="node-5" class="glossarize"><a class="milestone from-tei" title="Bookmark this section" href="#UT22084-044-003-4" id="UT22084-044-003-4">i.2</a> The Tibetan Kangyur translation of the sūtra is attributed in its colophon to the Indian scholars Jinamitra and Surendrabodhi, and the Tibetan monk Yeshé Dé. This would date its Tibetan translation to the early ninth century. As well as the Tibetan version<span class="text-en glossarize-complete title">, The Questions of Bhadrapāla the Merchant</span> is extant in two Chinese translations, one (T. 310) by the late sixth century Jnānagupta, and another (T. 347) by Divākara, who flourished in the late seventh century. Divākara’s Chinese version of the sūtra <span class="ignore">forms</span> the basis of a partial English translation by Garma C.C. Chang, included in his <span class="text-en glossarize-complete title">Treasury of Mahāyāna Sūtras</span>.<a class="footnote-link pop-up" href="#UT22084-044-003-215" id="link-to-UT22084-044-003-215">1</a> </p><p id="node-6" class="glossarize"><a class="milestone from-tei" title="Bookmark this section" href="#UT22084-044-003-5" id="UT22084-044-003-5">i.3</a> In its present <span class="ignore">form</span>, the sūtra consists of the questions of two interlocutors in addition to Bhadrapāla: Candrabhūti the merchant, and the prince Mahauṣadhi. The second section of the text, in which Mahauṣadhi features, reads in its opening passages rather like the beginning of a new sūtra, and may have once been a separate text.</p><p id="node-7" class="glossarize"><a class="milestone from-tei" title="Bookmark this section" href="#UT22084-044-003-6" id="UT22084-044-003-6">i.4</a> The sūtra focuses on the topic of consciousness: what is its nature, how does it relate to the physical body, and what happens to it after death? In his explanations, the Buddha employs metaphors and examples drawn from observation of the natural world, as well as from common Indian cultural beliefs. </p><p id="node-8" class="glossarize"><a class="milestone from-tei" title="Bookmark this section" href="#UT22084-044-003-7" id="UT22084-044-003-7">i.5</a> The Buddha declares that consciousness is formless or immaterial, but manifests through volition, feelings, and the domain of mental objects, or “element of dharmas.” In a similar way to a seed producing a sprout, consciousness generates a body for itself, and then controls that body just as a puppeteer controls a puppet. </p><p id="node-9" class="glossarize"><a class="milestone from-tei" title="Bookmark this section" href="#UT22084-044-003-8" id="UT22084-044-003-8">i.6</a> Doctrinally, the sūtra’s explanations of the relationship between consciousness and the body’s various constituents are not fully consistent with classic Abhidharma or Yogācāra theory. Chang, in a note to his translation of the text from Chinese, points to its unusual treatment of consciousness as an individual unity,<a class="footnote-link pop-up" href="#UT22084-044-003-216" id="link-to-UT22084-044-003-216">2</a> and Lindtner, referring to the Chinese translations of the sūtra, sees in it “pre-canonical” <span class="ignore">elements</span> that may go back to ideas in the Upaniṣads.<a class="footnote-link pop-up" href="#UT22084-044-003-217" id="link-to-UT22084-044-003-217">3</a> Nevertheless, it is very common in both the Kangyur and Tengyur that consciousness (as a unitary item) is listed as sixth in enumerations of the elements, and it is to that context that the term “the element of consciousness,” so frequently used in this text, is surely a reference.</p><p id="node-10" class="glossarize"><a class="milestone from-tei" title="Bookmark this section" href="#UT22084-044-003-9" id="UT22084-044-003-9">i.7</a> In a statement that could be read as foreshadowing the Cittamātra conception of an immaculate substratum consciousness, and the <span class="text-sa glossarize foreign">tathāgatagarbha</span> or Buddha-essence doctrine, the Buddha says: “the element of consciousness is completely purified; it encompasses all things, but it is not tainted by anything.” Consciousness acquires merit and non-merit in a similar way to a jewel taking on the color of whatever light to which it is exposed. </p><p id="node-11" class="glossarize"><a class="milestone from-tei" title="Bookmark this section" href="#UT22084-044-003-10" id="UT22084-044-003-10">i.8</a> The sūtra nonetheless underscores the benefits of meritorious action: the marvelous wealth and comforts enjoyed by Bhadrapāla, described in sumptuous detail, are the result of his virtuous conduct in former lives. Furthermore, the suffering of beings whose negative actions cause them to be reborn in the hell realms is vividly contrasted with the pleasures of those whose merit results in a higher rebirth, such as in the realms of the gods. </p></div></div></div></section><hr class="hidden-print" /><section id="body-title" class="page indent"><a href="#body-title" class="milestone hidden-print" title="Bookmark this section">tr.</a><h3>The Translation</h3><h2>The Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra</h2><h1>The Questions of Bhadrapāla the Merchant</h1></section><div id="translation"><section id="chapter-1" class="chapter indent text glossarize-section"><div class="render-in-viewport"><p id="node-12" class="glossarize"><a class="milestone from-tei" title="Bookmark this section" href="#UT22084-044-003-11" id="UT22084-044-003-11">1.1</a> <a class="ref" href="/source/UT22084-044-003.html?folio=71.a" data-ajax-target="#popup-footer-source .data-container">

Only now have I acquired faith in the Blessed One. That being so, I am someone who still marvels that it is thoughts of placing hope in certain things, searching for the Dharma, or being afflicted by the ills of saṃsāra that predominate; as such a person, please instruct me. Blessed One, I have harbored doubt. Sugata, because I was doubtful, I was deluded and did not seek liberation from saṃsāra. The Blessed One is omniscient and, as he provides all the necessities for achieving happiness, his unprecedented presence in the world is like that of a wish-fulfilling jewel. Because the Blessed One is affectionate toward all sentient beings, he is like their father and mother.” </p><p id="node-19" class="glossarize">The Blessed One replied to Bhadrapāla, “Bhadrapāla, ask, then, whatever you wish, and I shall delight you with my explanations in response.” </p><p id="node-20" class="glossarize">Wanting to ask his questions, Bhadrapāla stood to one side.</p><br /><p id="node-21" class="glossarize"><a class="milestone from-tei" title="Bookmark this section" href="#UT22084-044-003-16" id="UT22084-044-003-16">1.6</a>While Bhadrapāla, who was resplendent and perfectly handsome, was waiting on one side, the venerable Ānanda looked at him and said to the Blessed One, “Blessed One, the fine, prosperous looks of Bhadrapāla surpass even the splendor of a king.

Laughing and happy, they arouse excitement through the pleasure and delight that they create with their alluring, charming, and pleasant conversation. Through honoring their husbands, they praise their bodies. They have given up thoughts of desire for other men. They bow gracefully and wear fine shawls. They do not quarrel out of jealousy, scowl with hostility, or vie with each other. Their limbs, fingers, and toes are very soft; the joints of their limbs do not protrude; their limbs are fleshy; their hair is of even length and styled, wound to the right, and beautiful.

In some direction it sees the blood-spattered land of the denizens of hell, and then develops attachment toward it. After becoming attached, it produces the body of a hell-being.

Whoever remembers this Dharma discourse or carries it with them, who reads it, masters it, or disseminates it among other people, does not fear weapons, poison, fire, demons, water, or thieves.</p><p id="node-200" class="glossarize"><a class="milestone from-tei" title="Bookmark this section" href="#UT22084-044-003-147" id="UT22084-044-003-147">1.137</a>“Monks, from now on, you should not expound this discourse to those who lack faith, nor to those who cause disputes. You should not teach it to naked ascetics, nor to the disciples of naked ascetics. You should not expound it to those who subscribe to other doctrines. Moreover, you should not explain it unless it is requested. The reason for this is that were you to do so and someone were to become confused, you would then have created confusion about the Tathāgata. <a class="ref" href="/source/UT22084-044-003.html?folio=94.b" data-ajax-target="#popup-footer-source .data-container">
