Committed to writing around the start of the first millennium, these sūtras were expanded and contracted in the centuries that followed, eventually amounting to twenty-three volumes in the Tibetan Kangyur. Among them, The Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Ten Thousand Lines is a compact and coherent restatement of the long‌er versions, uniquely extant in Tibetan translation, without specific commentaries, and rarely studied. While the structure generally‌ follows that of the long‌er versions, chapters 1–2 conveniently summarize all three hundred and sixty-seven categories of phenomena, causal and fruitional attributes which the sūtra examines in the light‌ of wisdom or discriminative awareness. Chapter 31 and the final chapter 33 conclude with an appraisal of irreversible bodhisattvas, the pitfalls of rejecting this teaching, and the blessings that accrue from committing it to writing." />

Other evidence, not least the survival of the Kharoṣṭhī manuscript segments from Bajaur, suggests, on the contrary, that the sūtras were first committed to writing in the northwest. The epigraphic research of Richard Salomon at the University of Washington tends toward the latter view. The Arapacana alphabet found in some of the long‌er sūtras as a mnemonic incantation follows the order of letters and peculiarities of the Kharoṣṭhī script.<a class="footnote-link pop-up" href="#UT22084-031-002-19" id="link-to-UT22084-031-002-19">9</a> Furthermore, the earliest Chinese translation of the <span class="text-en glossarize-complete title">Eight Thousand Lines</span> (Taisho 224), dated 179–180 C.E., was prepared at Luoyang by Lokakṣema, a Kuṣāṇa monk from the northwest.<a class="footnote-link pop-up" href="#UT22084-031-002-20" id="link-to-UT22084-031-002-20">10</a> </p><p id="node-11" class="glossarize"><a class="milestone from-tei" title="Bookmark this section" href="#UT22084-031-002-21" id="UT22084-031-002-21">i.9</a>The fact that the sūtras were copied, expanded and translated rapidly into other‌ languages suggests that the admonishment to commit them‌ to writing as an act of merit was taken seriously by early proponents of the Great Vehicle.

Thinking that, fixation besides, there is nothing at all which can be apprehended, they see sentient beings grasping that which does not exist, and, through skill in means, release them, encouraging them to practice the transcendent perfections and abide in the fruits of attainment. </p>  <p id="node-134" class="glossarize"><a class="milestone from-tei" title="Bookmark this section" href="#UT22084-031-002-115" id="UT22084-031-002-115">i.98</a>After perfecting the six transcendent perfections, along‌ with the causal and fruitional attributes, bodhisattvas will themselves attain manifestly perfect buddhahood by means of wisdom that is instantaneously endowed with adamantine meditative stability. They purify the negativity of body, speech, and mind. Seized by great compassion, they may even take birth in lower realms for the sake of sentient beings, but remain untainted by any defects. Without apprehending anything at all, they abide in the emptiness of non-apprehension and attain manifestly perfect buddhahood.

That is to say, they give food to those who need food, drink to those who need drink, vehicles to those who need vehicles, clothing to those who need clothing, flowers to those who need flowers, garlands to those who need garlands, perfume to those who need perfume, unguents to those who need unguents, bedding to those who need bedding, asylum to those who need asylum, lamps who need lamps, <a class="ref" href="/source/UT22084-031-002.html?folio=323.b" data-ajax-target="#popup-footer-source .data-container">

Just as they make offerings to the tathāgatas, arhats, genuinely perfect buddhas, they also give religious robes, alms, bedding, medicines to cure the sick, and necessities to śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. They give flowers, garlands, perfume, unguents, powders, parasols, victory banners, ribbons, butter, grain-seed oils, and lamps. Just as they dispense generosity toward those who maintain ethical discipline, so they also dispense generosity toward those of degenerate morality. In the same way they dispense generosity toward human beings, and likewise they dispense generosity toward non-human beings. They do not discriminate between those who are worthy recipients and those who are unworthy. Rather, they dispense their generosity, having established the notion that all sentient beings are undifferentiated. If you ask why‌, since they realize that all things are undifferentiated, having comprehended and actualized this, they dispense generosity that is undifferentiated, and so they attain that which is undifferentiated—that is to say, omniscience.  </p><p id="node-2682" class="glossarize"><a class="milestone from-tei" title="Bookmark this section" href="#UT22084-031-002-2351" id="UT22084-031-002-2351">28.49</a>“Su­bhūti, if, when great bodhisattva beings perceive a living creature who has been born in the animal realm, they were to think, ‘The worthy recipient of my generosity is the genuinely perfect Buddha, but not a living creature born in the animal realm,’ they would lack the attributes of a bodhisattva. If you ask why‌, it is because when their own minds are purified, they [also] purify the worthy recipients of the bodhisattvas’ generosity. Great bodhisattva beings should rather think, ‘When I have attracted these impoverished sentient beings by my generosity, they will not steal the property of other‌s, they will be contented, <a class="ref" href="/source/UT22084-031-002.html?folio=324.a" data-ajax-target="#popup-footer-source .data-container">

Similarly, when I attract them by my generosity, they will not take the life of living creatures. Similarly, when I attract them by my generosity, they will not lie, they will not slander, they will not speak harsh words, and they will not speak nonsensical words. On these bases, after they have passed away, they will be reborn as a householder within the royal class, like a mighty sāl tree. Similarly, they will be reborn as a householder within the priestly class, like a mighty sāl tree. They will be reborn as a householder within the householder [or mercantile] class, like a mighty sāl tree. On this basis, by means of the vehicle of the śrāvakas, the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas, or the vehicle of the genuinely perfect buddhas, they will attain final nirvāṇa in the expanse of nirvāṇa, where there is no residue of the psycho-physical aggregates.’  </p><p id="node-2683" class="glossarize"><a class="milestone from-tei" title="Bookmark this section" href="#UT22084-031-002-2352" id="UT22084-031-002-2352">28.50</a>“But great bodhisattva beings should not cultivate disparate thoughts of vacillation, thinking, ‘Perhaps I should not keep my former vow to become the protector of unprotected sentient beings, to become a sanctuary for those without sanctuary, and to become a guide for who those without a guide?’ Or, even if other‌s, assailants or assassins, were to demand the body of a great bodhisattva being, they should not think, ‘Should I give it or not give it?’ Rather, with an unagitated mind, they should give their own bodies to those assailants and assassins.

But after I have passed away, you should rejoice, have faith in, and pay homage to this transcendent perfection of wisdom. Ā­nanda, after I have passed into final nirvāṇa, in any event, you should not squander this transcendent perfection of wisdom. After I have passed into final nirvāṇa, in any event, I shall entrust it to your hands, twice or thrice, so that not even a single syllable will vanish. Ā­nanda, you should know that, for as long‌ as this transcendent perfection of wisdom is active in the world, so long‌ will the tathāgatas reside in the world. You should know that so long‌ will the tathāgatas teach the sacred doctrine to sentient beings in the world. Ā­nanda, you should know that so long‌ will sentient beings behold the tathāgatas, and inseparably hear the sacred doctrine from the tathāgatas. You should know that so long‌ will renunciate modes of conduct be maintained in the presence of the tathāgatas.

It has a certain poetic resonance which more accurate renderings—“discernment,”, “discriminative awareness,” or “intelligence”—unfortunately lack. It should be remembered that in Abhidharma, <span class="text-sa glossarize foreign">prajñā</span> is classed as one of the five object-determining mental states (<span class="text-sa glossarize foreign">pañca­viṣaya­niyata</span>, <span class="text-wy glossarize foreign">yul nges lnga</span>), along‌side “will,” “resolve,” “mindfulness,” and “meditative stability.” Following A­saṅga’s <span class="text-sa glossarize-complete title">Abhi­dharma­sam­uccaya</span>, Jamgon Kongtrul (TOK, Book 6, Pt. 2, p. 498), defines <span class="text-sa glossarize foreign">prajñā</span> as “the discriminative awareness that analyzes specific and general characteristics.” Therefore “wisdom” in this <span class="ignore">context</span>‌ is to be understood in the cognitive or analytical Germanic sense of <span class=" glossarize foreign">witan</span> or <span class=" glossarize foreign">weis</span> (Dayal 1932: 136) and not as an abstract “body of knowledge,” or in any aloof and mysterious theosophical sense.

See Dayal (1932): 50–79, Williams (1989): 197–204, and Padmakara Translation Group (1994): 218–234. The śrāvakas are pious attendants who listen to the teachings that the buddhas taught by word of mouth, and place great emphasis on destroying the mistaken belief in personal identity (<span class="text-sa glossarize foreign">pudgala</span>, <span class="text-wy glossarize foreign">gang zag</span>) by overcoming all afflicted mental states. In the course of determining their own emancipation from cyclic existence, they may achieve in succession the fruit of entering the stream to nirvāṇa, the fruit of being tied to only one more rebirth, the fruit of being no longer subject to rebirth, and the fruit of arhatship. By contrast, the pratyekabuddhas are hermit buddhas who pursue their path to individual enlightenment in solitude or in small groups, without relying on a teacher and without communicating their understanding to other‌s. Following a natural predisposition for meditation through which they comprehend the twelve links of dependent origination in forward and reverse order, they are said to surpass the śrāvakas in the sense that they realize the emptiness of external phenomena, composed of atomic particles, in addition to realising the emptiness of personal identity. However, unlike bodhisattvas, they fail to realize that the internal phenomena of consciousness are also without inherent existence. Only the bodhisattvas resolve to attain manifestly perfect buddhahood or omniscience, in order to benefit all sentient beings.</div><div class="footnote indent glossarize" id="UT22084-031-002-10"><a class="scroll-to-anchor footnote-number" href="#link-to-UT22084-031-002-10" data-mark="#link-to-UT22084-031-002-10">5</a>The sūtras themselves frequently allude to proponents of the Vinaya and to upholders of the lesser vehicles (śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas) who would have balked at their unrelenting deconstruction of phenomena and buddha attributes, and sought to oppose them.

However, the present listing of thirty-three is markedly different in that it includes the eyeballs, aureole, and moonlike face (29–31), for which the aforementioned sources substitute the lion-like torso (<span class="text-sa glossarize foreign">siṃha­pūrvārdha­kāyatā</span>) and even teeth (<span class="text-sa glossarize foreign">sama­danta­tā</span>).

The lists presented in the two long‌er versions are identical, while the wording of the last mentioned varies slightly, albeit without significant differences in meaning. That standard list of eighty is largely reinterated in the <span class="text-sa glossarize-complete title">Abhi­samayālaṃkāra</span> and its <span class="text-sa glossarize-complete title">Spuṭārtha</span> commentary, pp. 89–90 (see also Sparham (2012 IV): 90–96 and 257–262; Conze (1975): 661–664; and Tsepak Rigdzin (1986): 165–166). The only differences, other‌ than in the order, between the list given in those three sūtra recensions and the <span class="text-sa glossarize-complete title">Abhi­samayālaṃkāra</span> is that the latter combines the purity and cleanliness of the body (21 and 23) in a single mark (21) while adding the perfection of the body (<span class="text-wy glossarize foreign">sku rnam par dgu pa</span>, 23), and it also subsitutes the thick and long earlobes (68) with long and extended arms. However, our present text contains many more divergent readings. In fact, twenty-six items of the standard list are missing and several other‌s appear to be combined or else only tentatively identified. About half of them do correspond to the standard <span class="text-sa glossarize-complete title">Sphuṭārtha</span> listing, although they are frequently presented in a different order.

This passage may also be compared to that found in Conze (1975): 586–587, which struggles to present a clear enumeration of eighty. The following notes 76–146, which all refer to discrepancies in the various listings of the minor marks, will be of interest to specialists rather than the general reader.</div><div class="footnote indent glossarize" id="UT22084-031-002-295"><a class="scroll-to-anchor footnote-number" href="#link-to-UT22084-031-002-295" data-mark="#link-to-UT22084-031-002-295">76</a> This is listed as number 1 in <span class="text-en glossarize-complete title">The Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Twenty-five Thousand Lines</span> and the <span class="text-sa glossarize-complete title">Sphuṭārtha</span>. </div><div class="footnote indent glossarize" id="UT22084-031-002-296"><a class="scroll-to-anchor footnote-number" href="#link-to-UT22084-031-002-296" data-mark="#link-to-UT22084-031-002-296">77</a>This is numbered 30 in <span class="text-en glossarize-complete title">The Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Twenty-five Thousand Lines</span> and 31 in the <span class="text-sa glossarize-complete title">Sphuṭārtha</span> listing.</div><div class="footnote indent glossarize" id="UT22084-031-002-298"><a class="scroll-to-anchor footnote-number" href="#link-to-UT22084-031-002-298" data-mark="#link-to-UT22084-031-002-298">78</a>This term is reconstructed in Konow (1941): 59.

In association with the four meditative concentrations, this single world system multiplies incrementally: The chiliocosm comprises one thousand such parallel worlds, the dichiliocosm one thousand of these, and the great trichiliocosmone thousand of these yet again.

When all levels of conceptualization dissolve and when all forms of dichotomizing tendencies are quelled through deliberate meditative deconstruction of conceptual elaborations, the ultimate nature of reality will finally become manifest.</p></div><div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4 occurences hidden-print match-height-overflow print-height-override" data-match-height="g-440"><h6>Finding passages containing this term...</h6></div></div></div><div class="glossary-item" id="UT22084-031-002-3360" data-match="match"><a class="milestone" title="Bookmark this section" href="#UT22084-031-002-3360">g.441</a><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-6 col-md-8 match-this-height print-width-override print-height-override" data-match-height="g-441"><h4 class="term">Emptiness as a gateway to liberation</h4><p class="text-wylie">rnam par thar pa’i sgo stong pa nyid</p><p class="text-bo">རྣམ་པར་ཐར་པའི་སྒོ་སྟོང་པ་ཉིད་</p><p class="text-sa">śūnyatā­vimokṣa­mukha</p><p class="term alternative">emptiness that is a gateway to liberation</p><p class="definition glossarize">First of the three gateways to liberation.</p></div><div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4 occurences hidden-print match-height-overflow print-height-override" data-match-height="g-441"><h6>Finding passages containing this term...</h6></div></div></div><div class="glossary-item" id="UT22084-031-002-3616" data-match="match"><a class="milestone" title="Bookmark this section" href="#UT22084-031-002-3616">g.442</a><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-6 col-md-8 match-this-height print-width-override print-height-override" data-match-height="g-442"><h4 class="term">Emptiness in all its finest aspects</h4><p class="text-wylie">rnam pa thams cad kyi mchog dang ldan pa’i stong pa nyid</p><p class="text-bo">རྣམ་པ་ཐམས་ཅད་ཀྱི་མཆོག་དང་ལྡན་པའི་སྟོང་པ་ཉིད་</p><p class="text-sa">sarvākāra­guṇopeta­śūnya­tā,

It is said that such a dissolution is experienced by ordinary beings, naturally, at the time of death, but it can also be experientially cultivated through certain meditative practices.</p></div><div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4 occurences hidden-print match-height-overflow print-height-override" data-match-height="g-901"><h6>Finding passages containing this term...</h6></div></div></div><div class="glossary-item" id="UT22084-031-002-4197" data-match="match"><a class="milestone" title="Bookmark this section" href="#UT22084-031-002-4197">g.902</a><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-6 col-md-8 match-this-height print-width-override print-height-override" data-match-height="g-902"><h4 class="term">Luminosity radiates as they walk</h4><p class="text-wylie">’od kyis gsal bar mdzad cing gshegs pa</p><p class="text-bo">འོད་ཀྱིས་གསལ་བར་མཛད་ཅིང་གཤེགས་པ་</p><p class="text-sa">prabhā­svara­gāmi­tā </p><p class="definition glossarize">Sixty-fourth of the eighty minor marks.</p></div><div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4 occurences hidden-print match-height-overflow print-height-override" data-match-height="g-902"><h6>Finding passages containing this term...</h6></div></div></div><div class="glossary-item" id="UT22084-031-002-4082" data-match="match"><a class="milestone" title="Bookmark this section" href="#UT22084-031-002-4082">g.903</a><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-6 col-md-8 match-this-height print-width-override print-height-override" data-match-height="g-903"><h4 class="term">Lying</h4><p class="text-wylie">rdzun du smra ba</p><p class="text-bo">རྫུན་དུ་སྨྲ་བ་</p><p class="text-sa">mṛṣā­vāda </p><p class="definition glossarize">Fourth of the ten non-virtuous actions.</p></div><div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4 occurences hidden-print match-height-overflow print-height-override" data-match-height="g-903"><h6>Finding passages containing this term...</h6></div></div></div><div class="glossary-item" id="UT22084-031-002-3868" data-match="match"><a class="milestone" title="Bookmark this section" href="#UT22084-031-002-3868">g.904</a><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-6 col-md-8 match-this-height print-width-override print-height-override" data-match-height="g-904"><h4 class="term">Madhyamaka</h4><p class="text-wylie">dbu ma</p><p class="text-bo">དབུ་མ་</p><p class="text-sa">madhya­maka </p><p class="definition glossarize">Derived from the Sanskrit expression <span class="text-sa glossarize foreign">madhyamapratipad</span>, meaning the “Middle Way” between the extremes of eternalism and nihilism, Madhyamaka is one of the most influential among the schools of Indian Buddhist philosophy since it emphasizes the deconstruction of all conceptual elaboration and the realization of emptiness.

In the Tibetan translations a śloka is usually rendered as a four-line verse. However, the term is also used (especially in catalogues of canonical works) as a unit measuring the length of texts written in prose or in a mixture of prose and verse, in which case it simply measures thirty-two syllables. The titles of the principal Prajñā­pāramitā sūtras, most of which are written in prose, identify them by including mention of their length in ślokas, usually translated in English as “in nnn lines.” The original titles, even in their long form, include only the number itself, and that this refers to the length in ślokas is by convention inferred.</p></div><div class="col-sm-6 col-md-4 occurences
